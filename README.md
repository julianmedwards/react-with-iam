# React App with Identity Access & Management

Mock React app to get the general tech stack working with an auth provider for my [Inventive Academy Final Project](https://github.com/julianmedwards/final-project-games-not-played).

The final prototype can be found at [this branch](https://github.com/julianmedwards/react-with-iam/tree/passport-jwt) using JWTs.

You can also see this abandoned [session-based version](https://github.com/julianmedwards/react-with-iam/tree/passport-session).
